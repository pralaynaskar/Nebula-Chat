## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) to evoke a futuristic feel.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) for a sleek, modern look with approximately 20% saturation of the hue of the primary color.
- Accent color: Electric indigo (#7C4DFF) to highlight interactive elements, which is approximately 30 degrees to the left of the primary hue.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' for a modern, tech-inspired look. Its suitability for headlines and shorter body text will align with the expected chat snippets.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons in a light color to contrast against the dark background.
- Design a clean, single-column layout with clear separation between messages. Use rounded message bubbles to soften the interface.
- Incorporate subtle animations for loading messages and transitioning between different models to enhance the user experience.
